    question: 'Do you provide execution support or only advisory?',
    answer:
      'We do both. Advisory starts with planning, then we help execute via AMFI and IRDAI registered partners while keeping documentation centralised.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How are you compensated?',
    answer:
      'Depending on the product we may receive regulated distributor commissions or charge a disclosed advisory fee. All costs are shared openly before onboarding.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Do you guarantee returns?',
    answer:
      'No. Mutual fund investments are subject to market risks and insurance/loan products have their own risks. We focus on suitability, diversification, and review discipline.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can you work with clients outside Kolkata?',
    answer:
      'Yes. Most of our workflows are digital-first. We serve clients across India and coordinate with NRIs via secure calls and document vaults.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What documents are needed for a consultation?',
    answer:
      'For the first call we only need your goals and approximate figures. For execution we will provide KYC checklists covering PAN, Aadhaar, income proofs, bank statements, etc.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How soon can I start investing after the consultation?',
    answer:
      'Simple SIP mandates can go live in 2-3 working days once KYC is complete. Insurance issuance and loan disbursals depend on underwriting timelines.'
